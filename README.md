=================

Vagrant setup for an empty multi node pacemaker cluster based on debian stable

I needed a quick an easy way to test config setups and wanted to cleanup and startover
just clone and vagrant up should do the trick to get a 2 node cluster, for more nodes just edit the vagrant config file
