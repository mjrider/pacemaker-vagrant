##2014-12-2 - Release 0.7.0
###Summary
This release refactors the main class to use `corosync::params` for defaults and no longer checks global variables for the parameters. It also includes strict variable support, a few other features, and a bugfix for EL platforms.

####Backwards Incompatible Changes
Class `corosync` no longer uses global varaibles `$::port`, `$::threads`, `$::port`, `$::bind_address`, `$::unicast_addresses`, `$::multicast_address`, or `$::enable_secauth`. These should be passed as parameters to the `corosync` class instead.

####Features
- Strict variable support
- Add support for spaces in `cs_primitive` parameters
- Add support for multiple operations with the same name
- Add some parameter validation

####Bugfixes
- Removed `enable corosync` exec for EL platforms

##2014-07-15 - Release 0.6.0

so the module can be uninstalled and upgraded via the puppet module command.

####Features
- Add support for PCS provider

##2014-06-24 - Release 0.5.0
###Summary

This module has undergone two years of development, and pretty much every
aspect of it has changed in some regard.  I've tried to capture the key
changes below, but you should rely on the README to see how things work
now.

####Features
- Added a new resource type cs_location.
- Make primitive utilization attributes managable.
- Added symmetrical parameter on cs_order (for ordering).
- Allow ordering of cs_groups.
- Allow to specify rrpmode and ttl.
- Allow to specifiy several rings.
- Permit broadcast.
- Allow more than two primitives per cs_colocation.
- Allow the authkey to be provided as a string.
- Add tests.
- Rework significant amounts of the provider code.

####Bugfixes
- Delete an existing cib to start fresh
- Only change /etc/defaults for corosync startup on Debian platforms
- Fix templates for Puppet 3.2+.
- Don't complain if cs_primitive doesn't have a utilization parameter.
- Consider <instance_attributes/> within primitive operations.
- Changed osfamily check to include other operating systems.
- Updated node to node_name in cs_location function as 'node' is a reserved
name, this replacement allows cs_location to work correctly.

##2012-10-14 - Release 0.1.0
- Added robustness for general corosync management (read the merges)
- Added `cs_group` type
- Added some testing
- Generally tried to get on top of this thing.
